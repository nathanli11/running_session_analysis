# Running Session Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes track running training data to provide guidance on whether it is possible to train for a trail race only on track and to assess whether the session is effective for preparing a 20 km trail with 1000m elevation gain (1000D+). 

## Project Structure
- **`Running_analysis.py`**: main script containing layout and visualization.  
- **`functions.py`**: helper functions for data processing and analysis.  
- **`data.fit`**: dataset from the training session.  

## Results
The interactive analysis can be accessed through the Streamlit application:
